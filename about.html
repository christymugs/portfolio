                    <p>
                        Hello, I’m Christy Mugomba, a passionate Computer Science graduate from Georgia State
                        University, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University.
                        My journey in technology is driven by a profound curiosity and a deep enthusiasm for web
                        development and artificial intelligence. I relish the challenge of solving complex problems and
                        continuously expanding my knowledge in these dynamic fields. My commitment to learning and
                        growing in technology is a reflection of my genuine love for innovation and progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond my technical pursuits, I am an avid reader, who finds solace in the pages of books that
                        transport me to different worlds and expand my perspectives. Traveling is another passion of
                        mine, as it allows me to explore diverse cultures, and embrace new experiences. Additionally, I
                        enjoy building Legos, a creative outlet that brings out my problem-solving skills in a fun and
                        tangible way. My favorite set of mine right now would have to be the Harry Potter Castle (I am
                        in Griffindor).
                        I’m also a devoted dog lover and share my life with a two-year-old mini golden doodle named Ace
                        who loves everything from toys to cuddles to movies and hikes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I look forward to pursuing a doctorate in the near futures and contributing to
                        the fields of AI and
                        nanotechnology, I remain grounded by my core belief: “If you have the courage to begin, you have
                        the courage to succeed.” This principle guides me in both my professional and personal
                        endeavors, inspiring me to approach each day with optimism, creativity, and a heartfelt
                        dedication to making a positive impact.
                    </p>
